  * SpringNamespaceExample - Simplified JRugged Spring Configuration allows you to add a jrugged namespace to your spring configuration greatly simplifying JRugged's use in your spring projects.
  * RunningExampleApp - Explains how to get the jrugged code and execute an example application that runs.
