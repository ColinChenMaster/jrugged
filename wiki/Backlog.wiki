= Introduction =

Here is a list of known items to work on, kept in priority order. If you have a new idea for a feature enhancement, please feel free to add it here in approximate priority. Let's see if wikification provides prioritization consensus!

Higher numbers are higher priority, so the list below should be in descending numerical (and priority order), with the most important at the top.

= Backlog =

  # Expose Monitorable/Status et al. and PerformanceMonitor as JMX controls.
  # Provide Spring-style wrappers to ease use and configuration, perhaps as a separate subproject (jrugged-spring).
  # Provide AOP wrappers for the ServiceWrapper interfaces to make it easier to do drop-in decoration of existing code.
  # Provide support for exposing Monitorable/Status as text/html or application/atom+xml web pages.
