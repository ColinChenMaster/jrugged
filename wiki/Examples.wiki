#summary A short compendium of examples of how to use the tools that jrugged provides.

= Introduction =

= Details =

  * DecoratorExample - How the jrugged core library utilizes the decorator pattern to wrap itself around method calls that you are making, allowing for things like circuit breakers and performance monitors to be easily added to your code.
  * SpringInterceptorExample - How the jrugged-spring library can be used in conjunction with the jrugged-core library to easily wrap existing methods and services with jrugged functionality.
  * RunningExampleApp - Explains how to get the jrugged code and execute an example application that runs.
  * PercentageFailureInterpreterExample - Using a combination of jrugged abilities to create a circuit breaker that trips based on percentage of failed requests rather than a tolerance window of failures per unit time.
 * PerformanceMonitorFilter -  This class is a standard Servlet filter that can be configured in web.xml to wrap all
 request handling in a org.fishwife.jrugged.PerformanceMonitor class.
