#summary Process for rolling releases of jrugged

= Release Process =

*Caveat*: Although jrugged is built with [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven], we're not currently set up correctly with SVN integration or repository integration to be able to simply use the [http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-release-plugin/ Maven Release Plugin]. Hopefully soon. At any rate, we have to do some things manually right now.

  # Make sure `mvn verify` completes successfully.
  # Update all the `pom.xml` files to the appropriate ReleaseVersionNumbers (no -SNAPSHOT)
  # Make sure `mvn verify` still works!
  # Check in updated poms.
  # Create the tag by copying the working branch (usually trunk) to the /tags directory with `svn cp`.
  # Update all the `pom.xml` files in the working branch to the next release version (with -SNAPSHOT again).
  # Check in the updated poms; development work can now continue against the working branch.
  # Check out the tag from the /tags directory.
  # Run `mvn package` and upload the appropriate artifacts to the project site on Google code.
    # JAR, apidocs, sources for jrugged-core, jrugged-aspects, jrugged-spring
    # source only for jrugged-examples
    # mark the new JARs as 'Featured'
  # Deploy new Javadoc to the S3 'jrugged' bucket and update links on the [http://code.google.com/p/jrugged/ project homepage].
  # Update the ChangeLog.
  # Send a mail announcing the release to all mailing lists.
