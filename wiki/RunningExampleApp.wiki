#summary Steps to get an example app up and running quickly.

*TODO Alert*: These steps need to be updated somewhat, as the examples are now a sub-project of the mainline codebase. However, the steps are similar in spirit to what's below.

To run the example app:

  * svn checkout http://jrugged.googlecode.com/svn/branches/jrugged-aspects-plus-examples
  * cd jrugged-aspects-plus-examples
  * mvn install
  * cd jrugged-examples
  * mvn jetty:run
  * Point your browser to localhost:8080/jrugged-examples and start clicking links.
